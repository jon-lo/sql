**Problem:**
The style of communication that allows one to succeed in the Revolut work context can be described as aggressive and un-empathetic. 
This manner of communication, while optimal in the Revolut environment, is actually not conducive to collaboration in more communal work environments. 

**Solution:**
It's important to adapt your style of communication to the working style of whichever company you are working in.
What works well in one environment can actually be detrimental in another. 
In some work environments you need to take time to establish and build relationships to get things done.
